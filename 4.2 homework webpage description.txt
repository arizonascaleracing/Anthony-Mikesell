So lets hope im in the ball park,sorry for my inability to type more professional,but im a heck of a speaker,trust me.

My basic page will simply be a place to see photos of work ive done and contacts i have established over the years.
So for the most part it should be simply a few minutes thru my eyes,and maybe you will see the beauty in it all.
Their will not be alot of links or convoluted things to try to navigate, just pics of stuff and a short description of my history in the R.C. industry and its application towards school.
